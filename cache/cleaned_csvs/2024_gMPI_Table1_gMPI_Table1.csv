Footnotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a. Not all indicators were available for all countries, so caution should be used in cross-country comparisons. When an indicator is missing, weights of available indicators are adjusted to 100 percent. See Technical Note at https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/mpi2024technicalnotes.pdf and OPHI Methodological Note 58 at https://ophi.org.uk/publications/MN-58 for details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b. D indicates data from Demographic and Health Surveys, M indicates data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, N indicates data from national surveys and P indicates data from Pan Arab Population and Family Health Surveys (see  https://hdr.undp.org/mpi-2024-faqs and OPHI Methodological Note 58 at https://ophi.org.uk/publications/MN-58 for the list of national surveys).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c. Missing indicator on cooking fuel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d. Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e. Value is not reported because it is based on a small number of multidimensionally poor people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f. Urban areas only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
g. Considers child deaths that occurred at any time because the survey did not collect the date of child deaths.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h. Revised estimate from the 2020 MPI.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i. Missing indicator on child mortality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
j. Missing indicator on nutrition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k. Captures only deaths of children under age 5 who died in the last five years and deaths of children ages 12â18 years who died in the last two years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
l. The methodology was adjusted to account for missing indicator on nutrition and incomplete indicator on child mortality (the survey did not collect the date of child deaths).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
m. Based on the version of data accessed on 7 June 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"n. Given the information available in the data, child mortality was constructed based on deaths that occurred between surveys- that is, between 2012 and 2014. Child deaths reported by an adult man in the household were taken into account because the date of death was reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
o. Missing indicator on housing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p. Revised estimate from the 2022 MPI based on the survey microdata update.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
q. Child mortality data were not used because the data were collected from a sample of women ages 15-49 that was not representative of the female population in that age group.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
r. Anthropometric data were collected from all children under age 5 and from selected individuals who are age 5 or older. Construction of the nutrition indicator was restricted to children under age 5 since the anthropometric sample is representative of the under 5 population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s. Indicator on sanitation follows the national classification in which pit latrine with slab is considered unimproved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"t. Following the national report, latrines are considered an improved source for the sanitation indicator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u. The analytical sample was restricted to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey sample, and its sample weight was used, because child mortality information was not collected for the National Immunization coverage Survey sample.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"v. Because of the high proportion of children excluded from nutrition indicators due to measurements not being taken, estimates based on the 2019 Serbia Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey should be interpreted with caution. The unweighted sample size used for the multidimensional poverty calculation is 82.8 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
w. Missing indicator on school attendance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x. The analytical sample was restricted to the round 2 sample because standard of living questions were not collected for the round 1 sample.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional Poverty Index: Proportion of the population that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Multidimensional poverty headcount: Population with a deprivation score of at least 33.3 percent. It is expressed as a share of the population in the survey year, the number of multidimensionally poor people in the survey year and the projected number of multidimensionally poor people in 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: Average deprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Inequality among the poor: Variance of individual deprivation scores of poor people. It is calculated by subtracting the deprivation score of each multidimensionally poor person from the intensity, squaring the differences and dividing the sum of the weighted squares by the number of multidimensionally poor people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population in severe multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population in severe multidimensional povertyâthat is, those with a deprivation score of 50 percent or more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population vulnerable to multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population at risk of suffering multiple deprivationsâthat is, those with a deprivation score of 20â33.3 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contribution of deprivation in dimension to overall multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the Multidimensional Poverty Index attributed to deprivations in each dimension.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population living below national poverty line: Percentage of the population living below the national poverty line, which is the poverty line deemed appropriate for a country by its authorities. National estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Population living below PPP $2.15 a day: Percentage of the population living below the international poverty line of $2.15 (in 2017 purchasing power parity [PPP] terms) a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
