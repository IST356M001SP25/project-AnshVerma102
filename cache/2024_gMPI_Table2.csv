Definitions ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI): Proportion of the population that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional poverty headcount: Population with a deprivation score of at least 33.3 percent. It is expressed as a share of the population in the survey year and the number of poor people in the survey year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: Average deprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People who are multidimensionally poor and deprived in each indicator: Percentage of the population that is multidimensionally poor and deprived in the given indicator (censored headcount ratio). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
